# JavaScript Advanced Functions: Conclusion

In this module, we've learned the attitude of JavaScript towards functions: it
loves them!

We've seen multiple ways of defining them:

* function declarations
* function expressions
* arrow function expressions

Then we saw JavaScript pass functions around in the collection-processing
methods like `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, etc. These lessons demonstrated that
we weren't using functions and their status as first-class data to their full
potential and that we could level-up our skills!

We then learned a new paradigm that embraces JavaScript's love of functions:
record-oriented programming. While we started by writing functions in a way
that was familiar, we learned to change our approach and pass an _execution
context_ when we called the function. We did so _explicitly_ using `call`,
`apply`, and `bind`. We also saw how JavaScript _implictly_ sets context
during function invocation. Lastly, we saw how the `this` keyword was our
magic hook for grabbing the context from within a function.

Yet life with `this` can be tricky, so we learned how to defend against lost-context
bugs and then stretched ourselves to build our own function-based
framework.

We've come a long way in this module and a thorough celebration is in order.
Hopefully, you've felt your mind stretch just a bit as you've come to
understand JavaScript's love of functions. We hope you've come to love
functions just a little bit more, too! Whatever's next in your study of
JavaScript, understanding JavaScript's love of and support for using,
passing, `call`-ing, `bind`-ing and using `this` is a crucial foundation for
growing amazing JavaScript programs. Congratulations!
